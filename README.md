## progress:
implemented neural network, which structure mutates over time and evolves over time
this is to find the best balance between complexity and efficiency.

future plans:
- create different islands, not all flat, maybe river, and change levels surrounding those
  - trees or foliage might help with that idea
- change platforms to be prettier, grass, rock? idk make it fit in with the rest
- option to change mutation rate
- add more levels
