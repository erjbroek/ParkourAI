## progress:
implemented neural network, which structure mutates and evolves over time,
to find the best balance between complexity and efficiency.




future plans:

- the ability to race the agents:
  - having only 1 or multiple agents
- after race ends, move camera back to previous position
- add a true final level
- display names of level
- remove code duplication in race text rendering
- increase player gravity a bit when falling 
- proper intro screen
- manually select the level you want to do on the screen
- change design of robots, to not be square. maybe a face is sufficient. Rotating the meshes in the movement direction could also help with this.

- maybe there is some way i can use actual grass. shaders, idk dont know much about them?
- redesign jump platforms
- change fitness calculation to also be related to speed (divided by amount of seconds for example)
- update fontsize based on screensize
